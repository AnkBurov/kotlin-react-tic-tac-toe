# Kotlin React tic tac toe

A bit evolved implementation of the [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
written in Kotlin for educational purposes.

Supports reactive dynamic board size changing, different needed line lengths for victory and
two game modes: human vs human and human vs AI.
- AI uses classic minimax algorithm  (without deep heuristics algorithms or alpha beta pruning).
